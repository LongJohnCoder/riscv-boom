Contributions welcome!
If you'd like to help but don't know where to start, check out the TODO file or the GitHub issues. 

**Bug Reports**

Good bug reports are invaluable!
Please try to provide reproducable code snippets and try to verify the behavior differs from the Spike RISC-V ISA simulator. 

**Feature Contributions**

We recommend that you consider contacting us before implementing your ideas.
This will give you early feedback on the likelihood that we will be able to accept your changes, that you will not conflict with existing efforts, and will give you guidance that will help save you time on your own implementation.

We also recommend that you try to cut up contributions into smaller, digestable pieces that are easier-to-review and easier-to-maintain.

**Style Guide**

You can invoke `make checkstyle` to verify that your changes respect the style guide.
In addition we have the following coding guidelines:

* Global variables should be in capital snake case
    * E.g. `GLOBAL_VARIABLE_NAME`
* Local variables should be in lowercase snake case
    * E.g. `local_variable_name`
* Classes should be in camel case with the first letter capitalized
    * E.g. `RegisterFile`
* Registers should be labeled with a `_r` after the name
    * E.g. `val f2_valid_r = Reg(...)`
* Queues should be labeled with a `_q` after the name
    * E.g. `val imem_resp_q = Queue(...)`
* If the variable is in a particular stage, please put the stage cycle it is associated with
    * E.g. `val f2_valid = Wire(...)`
* Braces for control structures (`for`, `while`, `if`, `when`, etc...) should be on the same line as the condition
    * E.g. `for (i <- something){`
* Braces for classes should be on the next line
    * E.g. `class SomeModule extends Module\n{`
* Braces for things such as `else`, `.otherwise`, etc should be on the next line
    * E.g. `if (...){\n...\n}\nelse{`
